# MetaModule1 Solidity Contract

This Solidity smart contract, named `MetaModule1`, includes functions for club entry, a calculation with non-zero denominator check, and class groups limitation.

## Functions

### `clubEntry(uint age)`

This function is used to determine if an individual is allowed to enter a club based on their age. It requires that the provided age is 18 or older.

### `calculation(int a, int b)`

This function performs a calculation on two integer parameters (`a` and `b`). It uses multiplication instead of division, and it checks that the denominator (`b`) is not zero.

### `classgroups(uint members)`

The `classgroups` function checks if the number of members provided does not exceed 5. It utilizes an assertion for this condition.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to a Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract through transactions, calling the specified functions.
